# **AI Car TORCS Agent using Q-Learning** 🏎️

**An autonomous driving agent built with Q-Learning and trained in the TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator) environment.**

---

## **📌 Project Summary**

**This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that learns to drive a car in the TORCS simulator using the Q-Learning algorithm.**  
The agent interacts with the environment, improves its driving policy through exploration and reward feedback, and is trained on **three different race tracks** to ensure generalization.
