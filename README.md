# **AI Car TORCS Agent using Q-Learning** 🏁

**An autonomous driving agent trained using Q-Learning in the TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator) environment.**

---

## **📌 Project Summary**

**This project focuses on building an AI agent that learns to drive a racing car in the TORCS simulator using the Q-Learning algorithm.**  
The agent improves its performance over time by interacting with the environment, choosing actions based on a Q-table, and optimizing for maximum reward.

## **🧠 Key Features**

- **Q-Learning Implementation** – Discrete state-action space with custom reward function.
- **TORCS Integration** – Utilizes the Gym-TORCS wrapper for seamless simulation control.
- **Training from Scratch** – Agent learns to drive without prior knowledge.
- **Q-Table Saving & Loading** – Persistent training progress.
- **Visualizations** – Training performance plots and logs.
